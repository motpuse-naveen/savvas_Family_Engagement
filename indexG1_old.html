Every day, your child is learning new skills and applying them to everyday life, and that application extends beyond the classroom. You can help your child by encouraging him or her to make connections. Here you will find everything you need to help your child succeed. Every little building block helps, so stack them up!</p>
                        <h2>What Are Foundational Skills?</h2>
                        <p class="width75">The Foundational Skills of reading are the building blocks of reading success. This year, your child will learn how letters create words, how words create sentences, and how sentences and pictures come together to create books. Your child will learn about the sounds of the English language and how those sounds are represented in print. The idea that print has meaning is the foundation of all that will come next.</p>
